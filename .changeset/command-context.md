Add `CommandContext`: one wrapper over the slash and prefix surfaces. `@Context()` injects it when the param type is `CommandContext`; the raw `ChatInputCommandInteraction | Message` union still injects untouched. One `reply` routes to followUp when the interaction was already answered; `ephemeral` is dropped on prefix instead of failing. `confirm()`, `paginate()`, and `pickOne()` accept the wrapper.

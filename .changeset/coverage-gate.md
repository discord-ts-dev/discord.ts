Fix two validation bugs found by the coverage pass: `validateDto` now calls `class-validator` with `forbidUnknownValues: false`, so plain DTOs without validator decorators pass instead of being blocked with "an unknown value was passed"; `resolveDiscordOptions` no longer clobbers `forRootAsync({ skipValidation: true })` with `undefined`. `deployWithModule()` and `bootstrapApp()` take an optional runtime factory for tests. The CLI runner sets `process.exitCode` instead of calling `process.exit`, so output flushes before the process ends.
